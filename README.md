# Pong Game

A basic pong game using HTML5 Canvas, written in ES6.

## Personal Learnings
Building Pong was a challenging task. When developing a game each decision has to be considered by the game maker; be it the trajectory
of the ball after it touches the paddle, the speed at which it moves across the board and the keys selected to allow the 
player control.

This game was a lesson in object oriented programming using classes, instantiating copies of code to be re-used and creating methods to control
interactions between other objects.
